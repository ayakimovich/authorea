  note-2 = {The article begins: ``The FORTRAN project was begun in the summer of 1954. Its purpose was to reduce by a large factor the task of preparing scientific problems for IBM's next large computer, the 704. If it were possible for the 704 to code problems for itself and produce as good programs as human codes (but without the errors), it was clear that large benefits could be achieved. For it was known that about two-thirds of the cost of solving most scientific and engineering problems on large computers was that of problem preparation. Furthermore, more than 90 percent of the elapsed time for a problem was usually devoted to planning, writing, and debugging the program. In many cases the development of a general plan for solving a problem was a small job in comparison to the task of devising and coding machine procedures to carry out the plan. The goal of the FORTRAN project was to enable the programmer to specify a numerical procedure using a concise language like that of mathematics and obtain automatically from this specification an efficient 704 program to carry out the procedure. It was expected that such a system would reduce the coding and debugging task to less than one-fifth of the job it had been.\par Two and one-half years and 18 man years have elapsed since the beginning of the project. The FORTRAN system is now complete. It has two components: the FORTRAN language, in which programs are written, and the translator or executive routine for the 704 which effects the translation of FORTRAN language programs into 704 programs. Descriptions of the FORTRAN language and the translator form the principal sections of this paper.''},
  note-3 = {The IBM 704 had 86 instructions, a 36-bit word signed-magnitude number representation, and a 15-bit word-addressed memory space (32768 words, or 191K 6-bit characters). Floating-point was {\em standard}, not optional. 4K-, 8K- and 32K-word systems were sold, but memory was treated cyclically, so programs compiled for one memory size could not run on a system with a different memory capacity. The machine was announced in 1954, and delivered in late 1955. From 1955 to 1960 123 machines were delivered. [From Gerrit A. Blaauw and Frederick P.
