\textbf{Describe the software in as much as is necessary to establish a vocabulary needed to explain its impact. }

A typical code conversion strategies for a high level programming languages involve either adaptation of the syntax of the source language to the syntax of the destination language or usage of the library translating the code of the source language "as is" in the environment of the destination language (Fig. 1).

\subsection{Software Architecture}

\textbf{Give a short overview of the overall software architecture; provide a pictorial component overview or similar (if possible). If necessary provide implementation details.}


\subsection{Software Functionalities}
\label{} 

\textbf{Present the major functionalities of the software.}
