\section{Conclusions}

\textbf{Set out the conclusion of this original software publication.}

We have developed MatlabCompat.jl - a Julia package aimed to assist conversion of Matlab/Octave code to Julia providing one-way compatibility between these languages. We show practical applicability of the software on a simplistic Matlab/Octave image analysis script ("janus.m"). This scripts is readily executable in MATLAB\textsuperscript{TM} R2014A and, upon simple parsing by a MatlabCompat.jl function (rossetta()) converting it to "janus.jl", thi script is readily executable in Julia 0.3.10.

We were able to reproduce performance comparison tests published on the official website of Julia within in a di This can potentially improve 

While our test environment was different, we argue that if was closer to the "out-of-the-box" user experience. Furthermore, we believe it was important to reconfirm the performance test results in a slightly different (potentially less optimized) environment to show the results stability.
