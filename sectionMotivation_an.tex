\section{Motivation and significance}
\label{} 

\textbf{Introduce the scientific background and the motivation for developing the software.}
Matlab/Octave is a technical computing programming language widely used through academic community. MATLAB has been introduced in late 1970s as an open source programming language for technical computing and later commercialized by MathWorks Inc. Being product of Mathworks Inc., MATLAB became extremely popular among primarily engineers providing a flexible solutions for linear algebra, differential equations and a number of other problems engineers deal with on a daily basis. Itroduced in the end of 1980s its syntaxial open source sibling, GNU Octave, offered an open source alternative to the commercial product of Mathworks.

Yet furthermore than a tool for engineers, in last three decades MATLAB/Octave has become a de facto default tool for developing scientific code, often used to solve problems it was not initially designed for.    

\textbf{Explain why the software is important, and describe the exact (scientific) problem(s) it solves.}


\textbf{Indicate in what way the software has contributed (or how it will contribute in the future) to the process of scientific discovery; if available, this is to be supported by citing a research paper using the software.}


\textbf{Provide a description of the experimental setting (how does the user use the software?).}


\textbf{Introduce related work in literature (cite or list algorithms used, other software etc.).}
