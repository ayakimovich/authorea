\section{Motivation and significance}
\label{} 

\textbf{Introduce the scientific background and the motivation for developing the software.}
Matlab/Octave is a technical computing programming language widely used through academic community. MATLAB has been introduced in late 1970s as an open source programming language for technical computing and later commercialized by MathWorks Inc. Being product of Mathworks Inc., MATLAB became popular among primarily engineers providing a flexible solutions for linear algebra, differential equations and a number of other problems engineers deal with on a daily basis \cite{moore2014matlab}. Itroduced in the end of 1980s its syntaxial sibling, GNU Octave, offered an open source alternative to the commercial product of Mathworks \cite{eaton1997gnu}.

Yet more than a tool for engineers, in last three decades MATLAB/Octave has become a \textit{de facto} default tool for developing scientific code, often used to solve problems it was not initially designed for. This, in turn, lead to an accumulation of prototype-like scientific software solutions unable to scale up to the promise and, thus, limiting research work. To address this, in recent years a number of new programming languages and frameworks has been proposed including SciPy for Python\cite{jones2001open, Olivier_2002}, Scilab and others. 

\textbf{Explain why the software is important, and describe the exact (scientific) problem(s) it solves.}


\textbf{Indicate in what way the software has contributed (or how it will contribute in the future) to the process of scientific discovery; if available, this is to be supported by citing a research paper using the software.}


\textbf{Provide a description of the experimental setting (how does the user use the software?).}


\textbf{Introduce related work in literature (cite or list algorithms used, other software etc.).}
