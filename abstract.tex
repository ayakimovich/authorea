\textbf{Abstract here, ca. 100 words.}
Scientific legacy code in Matlab/Octave not compatible with modernization of research workflows is vastly abundant throughout academic community. Performance of non-vectorized code written in Matlab/Octave represents a major burden. A new programming language for technical computing Julia, promises to address these issues. Although Julia syntax is similar to Matlab/Octave, porting code to Julia may be cumbersome for researchers. Here we present MatlabCompat.jl - a library aimed at simplifying the conversion of your Matlab/Octave code to Julia. We show using a simplistic image analysis use case that Matlab/Octave code can be easily ported to high performant Julia using MatlabCompat.jl.
