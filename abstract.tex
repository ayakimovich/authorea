\textbf{Abstract here, ca. 100 words.}
Scientific software coded in Matlab/Octave including legacy code not compatible with modernization of research work flows is vastly abundant throughout academic community. Performance of non-vectorized code written in Matlab/Octave represent a major burden. A new programming language for technical computing - Julia promises to address these issues. While Julia syntax is similar to Matlab/Octave porting your code to Julia may be cumbersome for researchers. Here we present MatlabCompat - a library aimed at simplifying the conversion of your Matlab/Octave code to Julia. We show using a simplistic image analysis use case that with tools we developed Matlab/Octave code can be easily ported to Julia.
